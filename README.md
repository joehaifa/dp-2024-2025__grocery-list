# My grocery list

Requirements:

- Java >= 21
- Git + GitHub account

## Useful commands

In the project, there is a maven wrapper. It is here to avoid having to install maven on your machine.
Depending on your os, you may need the `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd` script. I'll use `mvnw` in this readme.

All commands should be run from the project root directory.

### Compile the project

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

This will create a file ending with `.jar` files in the `target` directory.

### Run the project

```bash
java -jar ./target/dp-2024-2025__grocery-list-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Run the project tests

```bash
./mvnw test
```

### Run the project with a specific test

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=com.fges.SmokeTest#should_allways_pass
```

## What is this project about ?

The goal of this project is to create a simple grocery list application.
It was built fast, without any concern about maintainability.

It is a command line application.

If you are not familiar with CLI applications, you need to know a few things:

- Application starts with stdout, stderr and stdin
    - stderr: to log things for debug purpose
    - stdout: to output something
    - stdin: to communicate with the application while it is running
- Application can be ran with arguments (see 1000's of examples on the internet)
- Application terminated with a status code
    - 0 for success
    - anything else for failure

## Available commands at start

**Everything is temporary, this is just the state of the application at start**

The application takes track of a grocery list and store it in a json file.
The file structure

The application might currently have some bugs ðŸ˜±, but you are also here for that!

## What you can change

Well... Almost anything except:

- the commands in the readme should ALWAYS work
- use another language than Java
- use functional programming
- remove the `SmokeTest`
- remove the `Main` class
- change the `Main#main` method
- remove the `exec` method of change its return type to anything else other than the primitive `int`
- and of course anything outside the common ethic

## Features

### Add an groceryItem to the list

```bash
java -jar ./target/dp-2024-2025__grocery-list-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -s groceries.json add "Milk" 10
```

### List the groceryItems in the list

```bash
java -jar ./target/dp-2024-2025__grocery-list-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -s groceries.json list
```

### Remove an groceryItem from the list

```bash
java -jar ./target/dp-2024-2025__grocery-list-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -s groceries.json remove "Milk"
```

## About reports

Between **EACH** class there will be new things to add or change in the project.
You will have to:

- Do the new features
- Find and implement the testcases
- Write the report

Reports must be located in the `report` directory under the corresponding tp (ex: `reports/tp1` for the first one,
`reports/tp2` for the second).

Each time you will have to:

- Add a markdown file with the report content
- Add a schema to explain how the project works (class diagram, sequence diagram, as you want) in PNG or SVG format. It
  should be readable

In the report, explain what you did, your difficulties, your successes, your failures and what points were irritating in
the previous code that you add to fix.

### Submit your work

On Icampus, you will have a link to a website where you will find forms to submit your work.

You can submit your work early and continue working on it before the deadline.

Anything submitted after the deadline will not be considered, unless you email me before the deadline.
